    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <p>I am working toward becoming a professional soccer player and playing on the US women's national soccer team. I started playing soccer when I was around the age of 5 and haven't stopped since then. 
      I am currently on a team that plays in the best league in the US which is the ECNL league.I practice twice a week with my team and play showcases around the US. When I am not training with my team I go to the fields to train with my sister or friends.
      Over the summer I workout about 5 days a week and play in a Futsal league.A short term goal I hope to accomplish in the future is going D1 in college and playing for one of the best schools for women's soccer. I will not settle for less when I can do so much
      more and I won't stop trying until I get it done.I want to be known as hard working and dedicated to my sport. Being coachable is very important and I want to show love and passion for everything that I do, giving my all into it and helping those who need it.</p>
